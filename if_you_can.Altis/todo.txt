----------------- PLAY TEST 1 ----------------

Ideer:
  * Kill NPCs randomly (pro soldier)
  * Random location for gun (maybe parameter?)

------------------ PLAY TEST 2 ---------------

* Can poison dead soldiers.
  * Remove action when soldier is killed.
* JIP resets weaponContainers.
* Give SMGs (rifles) to soldiers.
  * Will correctly show weapon icons when they die.
  * Cannot use same SMG or else we cannot keep the easter egg.

Ideer:
  * Randomly spawn a new weapon to pick up. Less often than random NPC deaths,
    but just to keep everything interesing (otherwise, soldier gets it better
    and better as time goes on so why would it be a rush?)
